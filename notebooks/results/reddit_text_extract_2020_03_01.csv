BB,09/02/2021 04:00,"They are the forefront in the AI Autonomous cyber security software market, there is no other competitors besides Google, but does not have the patents and broad variety of software that BB provides. Partnerships with the 19 of the top 25 EV companies which make up 61% of the EV market. Not to mention the recent deal with ticker: BIDU to provide their QNX System to over 175 million EV’s. They’ve successfully moved on from their product sales of phones and at most majority of revenue comes from the software they provide to homes, stations, and EVs. 

They have completely wiped their department, obviously bringing in the Almighty papa chen who’s know for reviving software companies such as Sybase! A billion dollar software company with reported 55 consecutive profitable quarterly earning reports before they were bought out by SAP. Chen also announced today they signed a contract to provide power and cyber security to ISS for the next moon landing.

If you look at the analytics of their department, they revamped the company completely. By browsing linkedin they have a 3:1 ratio of engineers to sales, which means they are keen on developing their product and not so worried about sales. 

Edit: I also want to point out by looking at the TA from February 2nd on, BB is the only stock with a higher moving average to that of GME AMC and NOK. Throughout last week we can see it breaking the meme trend and acting on its own. Sorry I’m not sure how to add pictures but if you have the resources, you’ll see if you overlay all 4 stocks, they move very similar, but BB is the only one that breaks out right before market close. 

Edit 2: There’s a rumor that BB executives sold shares with the incentive to leave, remit ownership from BB, or have concerns of company being overvalued. Shares given to these executives are part of their salary compensation, so under company policy, they have every right to sell shares for capital gains. You can google search this yourself if you don’t believe so.

FB,09/02/2021 05:00,"Great long term play, and lately, BB is gaining a lot of short term traction. Media is picking up BB as a good buy, and BB is also bouncing back fast after a dip related to Robinhood restricting buying, misunderstood reports of execs selling (they do this regularly), and shorts riding the wave down to make a profit, which created artificial downward pressure.

BB also got a PT upgrade from Zacks to $29 and is rated as a strong buy on most websites now

Upcoming catalysts include settlement from FB (this month), Amazon + BB conference (this month), Q4 earnings (this month), and launching of more products and revenue streams related to IVY later this year

**Introduction**

“[FuboTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuboTV) ($FUBO) is an American streaming television service that focuses primarily on channels that distribute live sports, including NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, MLS and international soccer, plus news, network television series and movies.

Launched on January 1, 2015 as a soccer streaming service, FuboTV changed to an all-sports service in 2017 and then to a virtual multichannel video programming distributor (vMVPD) model. As a vMVPD, FuboTV still calls itself sports-first but its expanded channel lineup targets cord cutters, offering a selection of major cable channels and OTT-originated features that can be streamed through smart TVs, mobile and tablets and the web. The service is available in the United States, Canada and Spain as of 2018.""

From their [home](https://www.fubo.tv/welcome) page:

They are the only competitors in their space of digital sports broadcasting, offer 4K streaming and upscaling of live sports, cloud DVR capability ranging from 250 or 1000 hours on standard plans, and is available on Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Chromecast, Samsung Smart TVs, Xbox One, Android TV, Android Smart TVs, and Android/iOS smartphones and tablets, with plans ranging from $24.99/month to $79.99/month (not including add-ons).

[They have also recently acquired one company and have made plans to acquire another to allow for in-house sports betting. They have stated in a press release that they plan to release a sportsbook before the end of the year.](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/fubotv-accelerates-development-sportsbook-140000632.html) This will push them into a broader spectrum outside of only TV and sports streaming, and into the sports betting sector along with DraftKings ($DKNG), FanDuel ($PDYPY), and Penn National Gaming ($PENN).

[**Plans and Add-ons**](https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/channels)

FuboTV offers three standardized plans as of February 8, 2021: the Family plan is priced at $64.99/month (normally $75.97/month), Elite at $79.99/month (normally $100.95/month), and Latino Quarterly at $24.99/month, along with offering additional add-ons. Each plan offers a range of channels, cloud DVR capabilities (which allows fast-forwarding through commercials), and casting to multiple devices simultaneously. Only the Elite plan does not offer a 7-day free trial (*Channels page).*

The Family plan includes 117 channels (mostly news and entertainment with roughly 40 that offer sports, including ESPN), up to 250 hours of DVR space, and casting to 3 devices at once. The quarterly prepaid includes a free upgrade to 1000 hours of DVR space and 5 casting devices at home with 3 on the go (*Channels page).*

The Elite plan includes 164 channels (includes an additional “47 entertainment channels”), up to 1000 hours of DVR space, and casting to 5 devices at home with 3 on the go. This plan does not offer a quarterly prepaid (*Channels page).*

The Latino Quarterly plan includes 250 hours of DVR space and can be streamed on up to 3 devices at once, but only has 32 channels. This plan needs to be prepaid every 3 months for a total charge of $74.97 and does not offer a monthly service (*Channels page).*

Upgrades include additional DVR space--1000 hours for an additional $6.99/month for the Family and Latino Quarterly--and increased device casting--an additional 2 devices at home with 3 on the go for another $9.99/month for the Family and Latino Quarterly plans. You can also add a variety of channels and sports packages (the Latino Quarterly has fewer channel add-ons compared to the Family and Elite plans, which both have the same channel varieties). Sports Plus with NFL RedZone is an additional $10.99/month, but includes all professional and college sports broadcasting services for football, basketball, baseball, hockey, tennis, fighting, etc. (*Channels page).*

Fubo has recently removed its former Standard plan, which included only 65 channels, up to 2 casting devices, and only 30 hours of DVR support for $60/month.

**Financials and Growth**

Fubo has yet to file an annual report as they have gone public in October of 2020, but they have filed a [10-Q](https://s21.q4cdn.com/819998841/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/16be93b6-1b43-471a-a81f-a8b07e43e47c.pdf) for Q3 2020. All numbers in thousands.

Assets-

Between December 31, 2019 and September of 2020, assets have increased from $368,225 to $799,313 (a 117% increase) . Total current assets increased from $17,973 to $58,016, but accounts receivable decreased from $8,904 to $6,975--this may be attributed to the increase in prepaid subscriptions which increased from $1,445 to $12,177 which shows strong customer satisfaction and retention.

Liabilities-

Liabilities have increased from $145,049 to $290,376 (a 100% increase). The largest contributors to their liabilities are “Due to related parties” increasing from $665 to $85,847, “Warrant liabilities” increasing from $24 to $28,085, and “Accounts payable” from $36,373 to $61,679. Long-term borrowings have decreased from $43,982 to $25,905.

Revenues-

Subscription revenues increased by $53,433, totaling $92,945 for the year. Total revenues including advertisements and licensing have increased by $61,202, totaling $112,669 for the year and an increase of 47% YOY. Q4 revenue is estimated to be between $94,000 and $98,000 which would be a 77-84% increase YOY.

Expenses-

Subscriber related expenses total $114,315 for the year. Total expenses have totaled $500,249 for the year.

Subscribers-

Ended Q3 with 455,000 paid subscribers, a YOY increase of 58%, and plans to end 2020 with over 545,000, an increase of 72% YOY.

**The vMVPD Sector**

Cord-cutting has become increasingly popular over the last few years with consumers dropping traditional cable and satellite networks in favor of streaming services--such as Hulu, Netflix, Disney+, etc.--and vMVPD services.

[In 2019 alone, 6.3 million people cut their cable connection, totaling 39.3 million. In a survey of what they might miss most from cable networks, 52% said they don’t miss anything, 23% missed live events on TV, 22% missed news, and 19% missed live sports](https://www.emarketer.com/content/most-cord-cutters-aren-t-missing-cable-tv)*.* Although not all of those that miss aspects of cable will pay for another subscription service, the sentiment exists for a sports-focused platform that offers other large networks as well.

[Another report by Parks Associates reveals that 17% of vMVPD subscribers switched from traditional TV within the last twelve months. In the same report, a survey conducted on current broadband households determined that 43% were “likely to switch to a… vMVPD within the next 12 months](https://www.broadbandtechreport.com/video/article/14196415/report-examines-vmvpd-sector-growth-in-broadband-pay-tv-market)*.""* The potential growth exists for the live digital broadcasting space, although it is slowing down.

With the spread of COVID and quarantines, people have been spending more time at home. When things open and quarantines end, that will be the true test for these providers as people will spend less time watching TV.

**The Sports Betting Sector**

Legal sports betting has taken a huge leap in recent years with the introduction of online sports betting; the ability to place wagers from anywhere at any time and have instant gratification has boomed with its slow legalization. [This sector has a forecasted value of $150 billion with other competitors already having a completed project and vast market share. In 2019, DraftKings ($DKNG) and FanDuel (PDYPY) controlled 83% of the market share](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/27/fanduel-draftkings-race-to-win-150-billion-sports-betting-market.html).

[FuboTV plans to join into this space with its own sportsbook. Their recent acquisition of Balto Sports in December of 2020, whose business was in simulating fantasy sports games, is Fubo’s first step into sports wagering. They plan to create a free-to-play gaming system alongside online sports wagering](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201201006185/en/fuboTV-Acquires-Balto-Sports-as-First-Step-Into-Online-Sports-Wagering-Market)*.*

[Their next planned acquisition, which was announced in January of 2021, will be to acquire Vigtory, a sports betting and interactive gaming company. According to BusinessWire, they plan to utilize Vigtory’s “sportsbook platform and digital gaming assets, and its consumer-driven betting technology, to develop a frictionless betting experience for fubo’s customers](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112005596/en/fuboTV-Accelerates-Development-of-Sportsbook).""

These recent acquisitions set Fubo up to create an all-in-one viewing and betting experience, which could add new customers to their subscriber list and seal them into online wagering.

[It has been over two years since the Supreme Court has denied the federal ban on sports betting, which would have made online betting illegal in all of the United States. Currently, more than two dozen states have legalized sports betting, but most have only legalized in-person betting. More states may be willing to legalize to take advantage of the increased revenues and taxes associated with gambling and online wagering. As of 2020, six additional states plan to legalize some form of betting, although some are only allowing in-person. There are an additional 14 states that are considering the notion to allow legal gambling, whether in-person, online, or tribal](https://www.actionnetwork.com/news/legal-sports-betting-united-states-projections).

**Management and Investors**

David Gandler - CEO / Director / Co-Founder

Appointed as CEO and director in April of 2020. Prior to Fubo, Gandler had a 15 year career in marketing and advertising in local broadcast and cable TV within both general and Hispanic markets at companies such as Time Warner, Telemundo, and Scripps Networks Interactive.

Alberto Horihuela - CMO / Co-founder

In charge of marketing, Horihuela was head of Latin America for SVOD service DramaFever.

Simone Nardi - CFO

Nardi has worked as SVP and CFO of Scripps Networks Interactive where he was responsible for the finance and strategic planning for the company’s international business. Was also a key player in refinancing TVN S.A.’s billion dollar debt.

Large Investors

* Islet Management, LP with 5,108124 shares
* Morgan Stanley with 3,317,333 shares
* FMR LLC with 1,262,907 shares
* BlackRock Inc. with 956,678 shares
* Merger with FaceBank for $100 million revolving credit

**Analysts and Estimates**

Average analyst ratings put Fubo at a Buy to Strong Buy rating with an average price target of $45.50 with a high of $60 and a low of $30. EPS estimates are estimated to be -5.23 for 2020 and -1.64 for 2021.

Currently has a short float of about 75%, but the short volume has been holding at roughly 15-20% over the last month and has drastically declined from its October short volume of over 50%.

Originally valued at $700 million less than a year ago, a current valuation of $3.19 billion is respectable for this company and is on par for its current performance.

**Risks**

* Marketing fails and Fubo is never known as a household name, so consumers stick with other more known providers
* Their sportsbook fails and becomes dead weight and wasted money
* Subscriber count and streaming drops as quarantine lifts, reducing revenues while maintaining expenses
* Consumers opt for cheaper options
* People paying for the sports package cancel when the season is over, creating a boom and bust cycle if not managed correctly

**Final Thoughts / TL;DR**

With its drastic growth over the last year (400% in the last 4 months), support from FaceBank and well-known investors, and plans to join the sports betting sector, FuboTV has potential to become a household name and grow well beyond its current valuation by combining both sports broadcasting and online sports betting into one convenient place. Although unlikely to overthrow any of the current forces, it can become the best live sports broadcaster that people can turn to when they cut cable but want to keep live sports. It has many hurdles to overcome (creating their sportsbook, better marketing, increasing subscriber count, etc.) before it is any real competition to its already established competition.

At a $3.19 billion market cap and very high (75%) short interest, it will be very difficult to realize consistent growth, but it is on par for a company with almost $100 million in revenue.

**My Position**

25 shares at $47.30

NFLX,09/02/2021 00:00,"Enjoyed the read, thank you. I was thinking from a P/S point of view that (as of Friday close) $FUBO was at 6.33 while $NFLX was 9.76, a +54% increase. $ROKU is a bit insane at 20.6, but that's +226% compared to $FUBO. I think if they can have a really strong Q4 ER this stock is going to have a good time.

RKT,08/02/2021 23:00,"I’m a 20 year old college student/business owner with 55k in capital. I have a strategy that works great for me, but I am very curious about value investing and am picking it up very quickly. Maybe someone can point me in the right direction.

Charlie Munger said Warren and him have 3 general rules.

1.) A business with some intrinsic characteristics that give it some durable competitive advantage.

2.) Management in place with a lot of integrity and talent

3.) Finally, no matter how wonderful it is it cannot have an infinite price, we have to have a price that makes sense

RKT checks all these boxes which really gets me thinking “is it too good to be true?”. 

RKT is a holding company that has tons of subsidiaries in mortgage lending, making it the largest mortgage lender in the U.S. so it’s definitely a company I wouldn’t mind owning in 10 years. 

I am well aware that RKT is very new to the public, and I don’t think that’s a problem, I think it’s an opportunity considering how well established it is. 

I should also point out it has reliable earnings since it’s recent IPO mid 2020, and it’s low P/E ratio is very attractive. 

I’m interested in selling puts with about 20% of my portfolio at a strike of $20. In other words I’m looking to buy it at $20/share. When factoring in premium the price in which I buy will be much lower, and the premium will be a 1% gain which in my eyes is a jackpot! I know this isn’t an options community so bear with me...

In my case, 10k in collateral for 5 contracts at around .20 per share in premium expiring next Friday. If the contracts aren’t exercised then I repeat the process and make a whole bunch of money ultimately lowering the cost basis. If I do get exercised I collect 500 shares at $19.80, far below what I believe to be its intrinsic value. 

I’m hard to offend so give me your honest opinion on my first analysis! What do you guys think?",29,0.9948,0.052,0.764,0.183
RKT,08/02/2021 23:00,"I’m a big fan of RKT and I really believe this stock should be higher. It barcodes a lot though. Big banks don’t like the competition and short it to death.

RKT,09/02/2021 00:00,My worry about RKT is I don’t trust this housing market to last. COVID has caused a huge boom on houses with a flight from the cities to the suburbs and from apartment renters buying homes so they can have a yard. I know several realtors and know people in a few different places around the country(several of which have bought houses in the past year when they previously had no plans to) and they have all said the housing market is ridiculous right now. Everything is being bought quickly and prices have skyrocketed.

TV,08/02/2021 11:00,"It's the Year 2031AD (or 10PS, ""10 Post Squeeze"").

&nbsp;

I wake up in my GameStop-branded bed and pull back the curtains to another beautiful day. The surface of the moon is sparkling with the glistening glow of fresh tendies that rained overnight.

&nbsp;

I turn on the TV to check the value of the GMED (GameStop Dollar, the new global currency after the Great Squeeze of 2021) and find it has risen 1% overnight -- $12055 per share, not bad. The ongoing court case against the market manipulators looks like it will soon resolve in our favour; it's frustrating it has taken this long, but nobody said justice was quick.

&nbsp;

After finishing a delicious bowl of Nintendo Cereal System, which was brought back into GameStop shelves in 2029 to celebrate its 40th anniversary, I put on my shoes and coat to head to work.

&nbsp;

As I open my garage, I am greeted by my Lambo, custom plate ""GME21"", its yellow paint glimmering in the light. No matter how many times I sit behind the wheel of this beautiful machine, it somehow never gets old. I hope it never does.

&nbsp;

Feeling in a particularly good mood, I am driven to work with the power of Blackberry's latest EV technology along the freshly constructed moon highway to the sea of tranquility, where my workplace, GameStop MegaTower #4 is located. After their market cap reached $1 trillion, it didn't take long for GameStop to expand into every industry imaginable -- and some that were even beyond our imagination. 

&nbsp;

After a fulfilling morning trading $GME and GMED on the integalactic market, I decide to take the hyperloop to my favourite lunar restaurant for lunch. Andrew Left takes my order, looking a little dishevelled but otherwise relieved to have found a job somewhere to help pay off his debts. I exchange 0.00019 $GME for a plate of tendies with ketchup. It was delicious.

&nbsp;

I decide to take the afternoon off from work, as working is not a necessity for those who had diamond hands pre-squeeze. I stop off at GameStop on the way home to pick up the PS6 Slim and Nintendo Switch 2 XL, which I look forward to playing in the evening.

&nbsp;

As I sit in my living room enjoying my games, I sit back and wonder how life would have been so much different if I hadn't held with diamond hands. Through dips and spikes. What WallStreetBets and the internet community managed to pull off was the greatest wealth transfer in history, and life was never the same again. I shudder at the thought of a world where I had taken profits at $1,000 -- I would have enjoyed a nice holiday, sure, but those pleasures come-and-go. Only by holding were we able to change the world forever, to change the world into a fairer and brighter place.

&nbsp;

That night, I bow to my framed photograph of /u/deepfuckingvalue before falling asleep, a soft smile on my face, optimistic and excited for what awaits me tomorrow.",66,0.9988,0.027,0.752,0.221
