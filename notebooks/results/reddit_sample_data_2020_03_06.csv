lyihwq_BAC,BAC,lyihwq,05/03/2021 18:00,209,"Because I'm seeing a lot of posts about $150 will be the rocket or let's get it to this price by eod type posts I want to clarify gamma squeeze and what's going on for all you apes. Should you trust what I'm saying? No probably not, I'm a moron just like you, I'm bag holding just like you hoping for that moon shot. I do like the stock and I'll see you guys at Mars though.

Tl;dr if you believe in the short squeeze just fucking hodl. Call options with various strikes aren't going to cause the short squeeze we want. This is not financial advice I'm a fucking idiot holding 38 shares, I wanted to buy more but my wife's boyfriend wouldn't let me buy anymore.

No getting the price to $150 by eod will not trigger the short squeezeNo the price dipping today is not necessarily the result of some short attack. In fact the price movement today is exactly what should be expected because of delta, gamma, and charm and I expect it to dip more today.

There is only one thing that is going to trigger the short squeeze, not some magic end of day number, not some amount of options expiring itm, no the only thing that will trigger the short squeeze that we're hoping for is short sellers of the stock folding and starting to cover their positions, I'll get more into it below.

Now does gamma squeeze help us? YES! This is like super simple shit. Every stock is going to have buy pressure and sell pressure. If a stock has higher buy pressure than sell the price will go up and vice versa. We want as much buy pressure on the stock as we can possibly get from wherever we can get it. The price going up puts pressure on the short sellers of the stock because they're bleeding out of their ass on interest payments and the price going up only makes their losses worse and worse. So now to gamma squeeze.

So in order to understand gamma squeeze we need to understand delta. Now I know you guys love your fucking FD's you love those super otm cheap ass low time till expiration bull shit and probably haven't looked at a greek before in your life much less tried to understand them so I'll go over some basic shit. Now the following will all be general stuff.

Delta measures the change in price of the option based upon change in price of the underlying. An option with a delta of .25 if the stock goes up $1 the price of the option will go up .25 or $25.  Delta ranges from 0 - 1.0  options that are in the money meaning higher deltas. Super deep itm options have deltas super close to 1 and that makes sense if you think about it. I like BAC so I'm going to use BAC as an example. Don't go out and buy BAC unless you do your own DD on it though.

Say BAC is trading at $30 a share. I have a call option at $10 strike meaning if exercised I'd get 100 shares at $10 ie $1,000 and could sell them for a $2,000 gain immediately. This option would have a delta really close to 1. If BAC went up to $31 a share, my option would be worth $100 more because if I exercised I could instantly realize that gain (this is the intrinsic value of the option). I'm not going to go too deep into intrinsic and extrinsic value here if you don't understand it just go read the tl;dr above and go back to spamming the megathread.

Options that are at the money meaning the stock is trading at or really close to the strike have a delta at about .5 so long as there is still a decent chunk of time till expiry (I'll get into that more below).  The further you go out of the money the lower your delta because it's more likely your option expires worthless.

Now delta constantly changes depending on the price of the underlying and how it moves compared to your strike. This rate of change of delta is gamma. I've seen it described as delta as the velocity of the option and gamma as its acceleration.  The way gamma operates is that options that are super itm or super out of the money have very low gammas and gamma is highest when the option is at the money and this makes sense if we look at some examples.

Say I have a $75 call option on BAC and BAC is trading at $30. my option will have a stupid low delta because it is super likely it expires out of the money. Say BAC moves up to $31 a share, okay we're moving in the right direction but still super likely my call expires worthless so my delta will hardly be affected by that change. But suppose instead I had a $31 call option and BAC moved from $30 to $31, my delta is going to change much more because now it's way more likely my call expires itm so delta is changing much faster so gamma is higher.

This gets us to delta hedging and what the market makers that are selling all the short calls are doing. If I sell a call short that at expiration I'm agreeing to sell 100 shares at the strike price if the price is above the strike at expiration. If I sell a call that's way out of the money it's got a low delta.  Well I'm a little risk adverse there is a chance that call will get exercised so I need to make sure I have enough shares to cover that or at least make me feel safe. So I'm going to buy shares equal to my short calls delta. Now let's see this in action.  I sell a call option on BAC with a .2 Delta. A share of stock has a delta of 1 because think about it if an underlying goes up $1 my stock went up $1. Now my call option represents 100 shares so that .20 delta is really a 20 delta so if bought 20 shares and sold the .20 delta call I am delta neutral on BAC. say the stock rose $1 well now I'd be down $20 on my call option but I would be up $20 on the underlying stock that I have.

But since the price rose delta went up because it's closer to being itm so now I need to buy more shares to get back to delta neutral. Also it's closer to itm so now my gamma went up. Well the closer it gets to my strike price the more and more shares I need to buy and the faster I need to buy them to get to delta neutral. This increases the buy pressure. Well if there are a bunch of short calls at my strike price suddenly we're all scrambling to get back to our delta neutral position and puts enormous buy pressure on the stock that is until we get to our delta neutral position. This can and does cause a chain reaction on the other higher strikes, our buy pressure is increasing the price and now the higher strikes are getting more pressure, their gamma is increasing, they need to start buying to get back to delta neutral. This has the greatest effect at strikes with the greatest open interest. This chain reaction of increasing deltas and gammas is the gamma squeeze that people are talking about and it causes TEMPORARY buy pressure on the stock, once the short call sellers get back to delta neutrality the buy pressure evaporates for them.

So before where I said a stock atm will have a delta close .5 that's generally true when there is still a decent amount of time till expiration. Well the closer we get to expiration a stock atm will see an increase in that delta because there's a higher and higher chance you need to have those 100 shares to cover.   So today the short call holders at the 130 and below strikes may have had deltas lower than 1 so they didn't need to find the full 100to cover but come today the price held strong, now they suddenly need to find the last remaining shares to get up to 100 per contract. This puts buy pressure on the stock.  So this morning we saw a big surge of buys probably from those short call holders trying to cover themselves but then it tapered off because they managed to find the shares they needed and they'll just hold till end of day most likely.

Now come end of day we will probably see a sell off (and we already are) because the short call holders at say the $150 or above strikes are holding some number of shares to keep their delta neutral position but as we get closer and closer to end of day that delta is going to absolutely tank from another derivative greek called Charm. Now outside factors may dictate buy pressure from somewhere else so this is no guarantee on price movement today.

Charm measures the rate of change of delta compared to the time to expiration. Charm generally has very little effect on the price of the option up and until expiration. For example say it's 3:50 on expiration day BAC is trading at $30.50. A call option with a strike 0f $30 will have a delta at basically 1.00 because it's about to expire itm Charm will force the delta to that position and a call option with a strike of $31 will have a delta of basically 0 because it's about to expire otm and charm will force the delta to that position. If the price suddenly rose to $31 in the last ten minutes of trading charm will force the delta of the $31 call option to 1.00 or if it dipped to 29.50 it would force the delta of the $30 call to 0.

So now as we near expiration the out of the money call options are having their deltas wrecked by charm meaning those short call holders no longer need to hold as many shares to maintain delta neutral. This selling is putting sell pressure on the stock and will drive the price down at end of day which could cause other options strikes to go otm causing more sell off as charm wrecks their deltas (we saw this last Friday).

Now how does that affect the squeeze we want. Short sellers of the stock are bleeding out the ass with interest payments and have to watch their loss get worse and worse as the price of the underlying rises. More buy pressure is going to keep and hold this price up, we want buy pressure from wherever we can get it. At some point some short sellers are going to break, they'll say enough is enough I'm covering and will start buying shares to cover their short position so they stop bleeding. This is more buy pressure this will drive the price up, this will cause other short sellers to break which causes a chain reaction of short sellers flooding in to cover their short position. This is the squeeze we want and won't happen till they let it happen so just hodl. Now I may have got some of this wrong, please call me a retard in the comments section below.

I do see it as a good thing when calls expire in the money assuming the long call holders are exercising. Long call holders most likely have a bullish outlook on the stock and I see as being much more likely to be hodl'ers rather than short call sellers who are probably going to dump any shares they're holding the moment they no longer have the inverse delta pressure.

gpqq5wq_CRSR,CRSR,gpqq5wq,05/03/2021 05:00,5,"There are a few factors that are not helping CRSR. Short interest doesn't seem to be significant.

* IPO lockup expiring March 22nd -- every thread on CRSR mentions this, but not many talk about the actual numbers. There are ~14M shares that are eligible for unlock, and the current float is ~26M. Its hard to tell how many of those shares have actually been awarded to employees, but it is reasonable to expect existing shareholders to take profits leading up to the unlock, as well as employees looking to cash out of vested incentive stock options. 

* Semiconductor shortage -- you hear about this affecting the auto industry, but it has far reaching effects. CRSR's earnings call a month ago, the CEO specifically called out semiconductor lead times as a risk factor for their ability to react to increased demand in 2021. [1]

* Supply chain constraints -- related to above, in parts of 2020 they had very low inventory levels down to 1 week or less left of supply (in hardware this is a very thin buffer) and were ""sold out through most of last year"" (actual words said on the earnings call) which means even though they did great and grew over 100% in Q4, they could have sold more. [1]

* Controlled Company -- as others have mentioned, Eagletree Capital (a PE firm) owns the bulk of shares ~61M. What you dont hear is Eagletree also have 5 of 8 board seats (so more than 60% of the voting power) and the ""controlled company"" status has some potential downsides: different reporting requirements, fewer rights to shareholders, and a board that may serve the interests of a single stockholder.

The last few weeks really has me contemplating my past decisions. Thinking about selling everything below (Current) besides BNGO, and getting into more conservative positions (Future?). I've been sticking to growth/high IV/meme-ish stocks for a little bit riding the wave of call writing. But as of late it has bitten me pretty hard, so I'm thinking about repositioning, portfolio is down 50% currently. Please let me know your thoughts. Trying to balance the sectors more but not sure if I'm missing something? Excited to build out some dividend growth and I will continue to write weekly calls on these stocks. I'm in my 30's. Is this move too conservative in relation to my expected time remaining in the market? For reference the goal would be to buy just 100 shares of each of the companies below (Future?), write calls, collect premium, collect dividends etc. but in a safer manner than the wild swings on the growth side. Current short term goal = make supplemental income to pay down student loans and car.

Should I still make this move but leave 5-10% of my portfolio for high IV tickers? It's hard to walk away from some of the premiums I've captured through the high IV side but I've known that may not be as sustainable long term (last 2 weeks proved that the hard way, no end in sight). OR do I wait out this dip/correction/crash and keep writing calls against current holdings until I can make back some of my original gains? Then reposition at a later date? Thanks!

Trying to balance the sectors more but not sure if I'm missing something? Excited to build out some dividend growth and I will continue to write weekly calls on these stocks. I'm in my 30's. Is this move too conservative in relation to my expected time remaining in the market? For reference the goal would be to buy just 100 shares of each of the companies below (Future?), write calls, collect premium, collect dividends etc. but in a safer manner than the wild swings on the growth side. Current short term goal = make supplemental income to pay down student loans and car.

Should I still make this move but leave 5-10% of my portfolio for high IV tickers? It's hard to walk away from some of the premiums I've captured through the high IV side but I've known that may not be as sustainable long term (last 2 weeks proved that the hard way, no end in sight). OR do I wait out this dip/correction/crash and keep writing calls against current holdings until I can make back some of my original gains? Then reposition at a later date? Thanks!

The last few weeks really has me contemplating my past decisions. Thinking about selling everything below (Current) besides BNGO, and getting into more conservative positions (Future?). I've been sticking to growth/high IV/meme-ish stocks for a little bit riding the wave of call writing. But as of late it has bitten me pretty hard, so I'm thinking about repositioning, portfolio is down 50% currently. Please let me know your thoughts. Trying to balance the sectors more but not sure if I'm missing something? Excited to build out some dividend growth and I will continue to write weekly calls on these stocks. I'm in my 30's. Is this move too conservative in relation to my expected time remaining in the market? For reference the goal would be to buy just 100 shares of each of the companies below (Future?), write calls, collect premium, collect dividends etc. but in a safer manner than the wild swings on the growth side. Current short term goal = make supplemental income to pay down student loans and car.

Should I still make this move but leave 5-10% of my portfolio for high IV tickers? It's hard to walk away from some of the premiums I've captured through the high IV side but I've known that may not be as sustainable long term (last 2 weeks proved that the hard way, no end in sight). OR do I wait out this dip/correction/crash and keep writing calls against current holdings until I can make back some of my original gains? Then reposition at a later date? Thanks!

And I've always felt that when every TV analyst is screaming about how we haven't hit the bottom yet, that's a good contrarian signal that we *are* at the bottom. The market never acts the way people think it will.

That said, be safe, be prepared for a bigger dip, save some cash, and don't panic. But also never forget that the TV analysts know as much about the true future of the stock market as you do, which is: zippo.",stocks,comment,0.9714,0.049,0.727,0.224,0,reddit

gpvvnl0_TSLA,TSLA,gpvvnl0,06/03/2021 07:00,81,"I was a TSLA bear for a long time because I wanted to stay ""rational"":

1. Someone close to me is very familiar with the car industry and he kept talking about car industry's  ""low margins"" and their ""fragility with any defects,"" etc., etc.
2. I read TOO many comments here and especially on reddit/investing about the fundamentals and the value and ""the P/E ratio, and how crazy overvalued it is"" even when the stock was 70 dollars. (Yes, there is a W. Buffet kind of investing, but there is also the Templeton kind, and Templeton would have bought Tesla.)

I was happy to dive all in during this drop:

1. Because Nobel Prizes in economy have been awarded for the research showing that economy is not simply rational, but also emotional. (If people love a product, they will support it.)
2. Because even Warren Buffet, the ultimate value investor, said that one of the reasons you should buy a stock is if you are proud to take ownership (however small) in a company. I love Tesla's vision. I love their cars. I love their philosophy. I'm proud to own a tiny bit of them.
3. Even the car-industry family member admitted that carmakers never manage to put their prototype-ideal on the road (which is what all these competitors are up against), but that Musk achieved this, despite the fact that it is almost impossible. That is the kind of S. Jobs-leadership I trust.
4. I have a 13-year-old student in China whom I teach online. She's brilliant and fascinated with science. One day, she said: ""I saw a Tesla today in my neighborhood!"" and her eyes sparkled. Yes, this is just an anecdote, but I was taken aback because she is not a materialist, and her love for this Tesla car she saw was the love for future, for science, for cleaner air and new technologies.

If I lose on this investment, I'll be at peace with it. I do need the money, as any middle class person does, but (after buying boring and rational investments) I'm finally standing behind a product and a company that I do believe in, respect, and even love.

Here's a simple question: **What is a stock worth right now and why?**

There's lots of ways to answer this question, many (revenue multiples, earnings multiples, etc) are short hand or simplified ways of describing the same thing.

The foundation of modern finance answers this with: **The Present Value of all Future Cash Flows**

Regardless of whether you're talking about equity in a growth tech company, a value oriented utilities operator, or even a distressed oil company, the answer can be broken down further into two components or sets of assumptions:

1. What are those future cash flows this company will produce for this equity share I'm buying?
2. What discount do I give them to calculate their value today?

# Future Cash Flows:

The first component I imagine everyone is conceptually super familiar with. Everyone see's headlines about revenue growth or earnings growth and some kind of % figure that gets them excited. So when it comes to the value of equity, which do we care about?

The answer here is less commonly thrown around. The cash flows we calculate into for an equity valuation are the **Free Cash Flow to Equity**, or **FCFE.**

In short, **FCFE** is how much cash is available to all shareholders **AFTER** all expenses, reinvestment, and debts have been paid. A comparison for personal income would be, this is like calculating how much you have left each month from your paycheck after you take out taxes, pay for groceries, pay that student loan bill, pay rent, and pay for that oil change on your car.

So how do you calculate a company's **FCFE**? Thankfully lots of companies do this already in their non-GAAP calculations, but if they don't it's relatively simple on your own.

`FCFE = CFO - Capital Expenditures + Net Debt`

Thankfully CFO is a standard GAAP accounting figure you'll always have. Capital expenditures are generally straight forward but can be disguised. And net debt is the net change in debt balances, if you issue more debt, more cash is coming in the door, that's considered that higher cash flow to the shareholders.

So this gives you an idea of excess cash that theoretically is coming back into your pocket as an owner of the equity. But you can't do this for infinite years right? At some point you have to just create a final value at some point in the future. This is called our ""Terminal Value"" and it represents some generic assumptions about growth and costs of capital to give you an idea of what all the years beyond that are worth. The formula is pretty straight forward. If I want build a 5 year model, I will include my terminal value in year 5. The formula for figuring this out is as follows:

`Terminal CF = yr 5 FCFE * (1+g) / (WACC - g)`

Now there's a couple ways to think about this, but the easiest way is to simply view it as the value of all cash flows AFTER year 5 at an **assumed growth rate (g)** and assumed **cost of capital (WACC)**. This value is calculated as if you existed in year 5 already and assumed long run growth rate is also the same as the long run rate of growth in the economy. If you subscribe to Damodan's school of valuation (widely viewed as the authority on equity valuation modeling), there is an argument for g being the nominal gdp growth rate.

Now that we've put together the string of cash flows, what is the actual value of what you're receiving?

# Discount Rates:

This is the second component of the answer fewer people on here seem to incorporate when thinking about stocks. The idea here is that there is some inherent discount you need to apply to something you're going to receive in the future. It's a little bit longer but stick with me.

Let's take a step back and think about what that means. If I say I'm going to give you $100 tomorrow, generally you're pretty safe in assuming that's the same as having $100 today right? Cool that's fairly easy. Now what if I tell you I'll give you $50 in 10 years and $50 in 20 years. Are you going to value that the same as scenario 1? No right? Because if you get $100 tomorrow there's still 10+ years of time to do more productive things with that money than you would have in scenario 2 (i.e. invest it etc).

So how does this apply to valuations? Think of all those cash flows we talked about before. The value of ""buying the thing that gives you those cash flows"" is basically all of them summed up right? **Wrong**. Remember those cash flows are in the future... And things in the future are intrinsically worth less than they are today.

So how do we figure out what they worth today? Well that brings us to one of the most fundamental formulas in all of finance:

`FV = PV (1+r)^t`

That is, for a **given rate of growth (r)** and a **given amount of time (t)**, we can figure out what the future value of any amount will be.  If we know our future values, but not our present, then we can just flip this around and solve it the other way:

`PV = FV / (1+r)^t`

We already know FV is just the cash flows we talked about above already. So what is the 1/(1+r)\^t? That's what we call our discount factor and this is where we are finally getting to the topic of this post's title. t is super easy, years are years unless you're some sort of time traveler. The real question here is **""HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT RATE TO USE?""**. The answer in finance to discount your cash flows by the company's **Weighted Average Cost of Capital** or **WACC**. The concept here is that cost of capital comes in two broad components, cost of debt, and cost of equity. Cost of debt is sort of self explanatory. You have some debt, you owe interest on it each year, there's some marginal tax benefit by interest payments lowering your tax obligations, etc. But let's ignore this for a second and pretend we're looking at a company with zero debt.

What the fuck is ""**cost of equity**"" and what does it mean? It's far less tangible of a concept because there are no explicit interest payments that you can point to as ""costs"" like there are for debt. Instead some nobel prize winning financial economists (Jack Treynor \[mentor of Fischer Black\], William Sharpe \[known for the Sharpe Ratio\], and Merton Miller \[known for Modigliani-Miller Theory\]) captured essence of determining an equity share's ""cost"" through a theory called the **Capital Asset Pricing Model** or **CAPM** for short. This was a formula designed to determine what ""cost"" should be assigned to an asset based on a risk free rate of return, a market rate of return, and the inherent correlation of your asset with that market. You can see where I'm going with this. The formula is as follows:

`R(E) = Rrfr + B*(ERP)`

R(E) here represents the expected return of an asset. This can also be called your expected return on an equity or to the company issuing this equity it is the ""cost"" to them that's expected in return for the investor buying their equity.

Rrfr is just shorthand for the expected return on a risk free asset. You wouldn't ever buy into an equity share with the expectation that it gives you less than what the most risk free asset is right? Cool. So in the broad scheme of things there's a couple of things you could use for this, but one of the most common is the 10 year US Treasury yield (or some other duration US Treasury note/bill/bond). The US Government is widely believed to be the most risk free counterparty in the world. It's the nature of being a reserve currency.

B is your assets beta to the market. There's a lot we can unpack with this but for an oversimplification, let's think of it as for every 1% the broad market changes, how much does your equity change by?

And finally, ERP. This is the Equity Risk Premium. There's several ways to approach this but the simplest is to think of it as the general expectation of investors as to how much the broad market should outperform risk free assets. People purchase equity shares with the expectation of higher returns than safer assets? Seems reasonable.

Let's try this out with the broad market. Let's assume beta (B) is 1.0, the risk free rate is 1.0% and the ERP (expected spread between risk free and market) is 8%.

`R(E) = 1.5% + 1.0*(8%) = 9.5%`

That's a fairly reasonable rate. The sanity check here is comparing it to cost of debt. Because equities are lower in the capital structure, their cost should explicitly always be higher than the cost of debt. In the broad market companies are borrowing at less than 9.5% so that rough eyeball test checks out. If you invest in the broad equity market, your expectation is for companies to deliver 9.5% in value to you each year.

This finally brings us back to the topic of this post. You can see, wayyyy down in the granular details of a valuation, the equity markets fundamental valuation are inherently baselined on risk free rates. Now let's combine this with what we talked about above and see why such small changes in that tiny rate can have such large outcomes in valuations.

# Case Study: QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE: $QS)

I'll be honest, the reason I chose this is largely because it's one of the extreme examples that demonstrates how such small changes can make disproportionate impact. Also it seems to be a fan favorite whenever I see it mentioned.

For a case study I want to do a super rudimentary valuation. For disclosure, this is not a robust valuation or financial advice. I'm going to eliminate as many factors as possible and try to keep it just to what we talked about and help illustrate things. I'm not putting this here as DD or an opinion on this stock.

First things first, lets get some cash flows. For this we're not going to do anything fancy. When they were acquired by the \[insert s word thing that shall not be named\] they gave management forecasts and we're just going to take them at face value and extrapolate. Their projected first revenues will come in 2024 but it's nothing really material (14m FY24, 39m FY25, 260m FY26) until we get to FY27 (3.2bn). But remember, we don't care about revenues because as equity holders that's not what we receive. Looking at management's forecast, their Free Cash Flow doesn't turn positive until FY28 when it makes up \~8.5% of revenues. So lets use this and use some really wild assumptions. I'm going to say revenues go up by 75% each year after that and FCF margins stay the same at 10% (pretty insane growth assumptions given such a capital intensive manufacturing company).

&#x200B;

||2028|2029|2030|2031|2032|2033|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues ($m)|6500|11,375|19,906|34,836|60,963|106,685|
|Free Cash Flow ($m)|565|1,138|1,991|3,484|6,096|10,669|

Now we need to find our terminal value as if it is at the end of 2033 looking forward. Let's assume a relatively high steady state growth of 5% (3% real growth and 2% inflation). So our figure in year 5 is 106\*(1.05)/(.19-.05) = $133.3 billion

At first glance impressions are easy to be ""holy fuck, they're going to have $100 billion in revenue? they're generating cash flows of $150 billion?!? they're only at $15 billion market cap?? sign me the fuck up! buy buy buy!"". But let's take this all the way with step 2 of answering our ""What is this worth today?"" question.

So for this part we need to make a lot of assumptions. And this is important because equity analysts express their views often the most through not assumptions on how a company's cash flows look, but how to think about those cash flow value in present dollars.

Continuing our simplification, let's keep assuming no debt involvement here (mainly bc this post is fucking long) and let's jump back to using CAPM. Let's use the below values:

Rrfr: 1.0%

Beta: 2.0

ERP: 10%

Using these we can see this stock's cost of equity is \~21.0%. It seems high, but this is expected from something with such fantastic growth being priced in to have such a high beta. TSLA for example has a beta of 2.0 and realistically a stock growing at 75% yoy in an economy growing at 3% nominally would likely have a beta much higher than that.

So using our formula's above we can now now solve for our discount factors (the 1/(1+r)\^t numbers to multiply our cash flows by).

&#x200B;

|Discount Factor|= 1 / (1.21)^(8)|= 1 / (1.21)^(9)|= 1 / (1.21)^(10)|= 1 / (1.21)^(11)|= 1 / (1.21)^(12)|= 1 / (1.21)^(13)|
|(DF)|0.22|0.18|0.15|0.12|0.10|0.08|
|PV CF ($m)|141|205|296|428|619|10,686|

The sum of all the PV CF should give us what we think this stock is worth today (since no debt, this would be same as market cap, ignoring any cash balances they currently have). So we get $12.4bn. Compared to a current $15 billion market cap that's another 20% drop WITH some pretty damn rosy assumptions (and low yields). Fuck.

But that's not all.

Now let's dial in new more realistic assumptions. Let's think of pre-covid life and what the norms back then were. 10 year interest rates were between 2-3% in 2018/2019 and inflation was tipping on the hot side of 2% going into end of year 2019, so a 10 year treasury at 2.5% seems a realistic norm and with a higher vol/growth stock like this we can be more realistically at a beta of 2.25. And finally let's keep our ERP and g (macro assumptions) the same.

Our cost of equity is now 25% which makes our discount table look like this:

|Year|FY2028|FY2029|FY2030|FY2031|FY2032|FY2033|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|t|8|9|10|11|12|13|
|WACC|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|
|Discount Factor|= 1 / (1.25)^(8)|= 1 / (1.25)^(9)|= 1 / (1.25)^(10)|= 1 / (1.25)^(11)|= 1 / (1.25)^(12)|= 1 / (1.25)^(13)|
|(DF)|0.17|0.13|0.11|0.09|0.07|0.05|
|PV CF ($m)|109|153|214|299|419|5,718|

With just a slight change in treasury yields and a slightly more realistic shift in beta, we're now talking about a market cap of $6.9bn or a 55% FURTHER DROP from current prices. Start shifting those 75%/yoy growth assumptions towards something that decelerates (a more complicated n-stage DCF that's too much to get into here) and you drop even further. A 10% deceleration yoy would bring this present value more in the $4 billion range.

I'm sorry for being so long winded here, but I felt it was important to explain. In a nutshell that folks, is the power of compounding and why small shifts in a seemingly benign rate can shift massive changes in values for these growth stocks that are primarily basing their value on cash flows happening 10-15 years from now.",stocks,submission,0.9997,0.053,0.811,0.135,50,reddit

A comparison for personal income would be, this is like calculating how much you have left each month from your paycheck after you take out taxes, pay for groceries, pay that student loan bill, pay rent, and pay for that oil change on your car.

So how do you calculate a company's **FCFE**? Thankfully lots of companies do this already in their non-GAAP calculations, but if they don't it's relatively simple on your own.

`FCFE = CFO - Capital Expenditures + Net Debt`

Thankfully CFO is a standard GAAP accounting figure you'll always have. Capital expenditures are generally straight forward but can be disguised. And net debt is the net change in debt balances, if you issue more debt, more cash is coming in the door, that's considered that higher cash flow to the shareholders.

So this gives you an idea of excess cash that theoretically is coming back into your pocket as an owner of the equity. But you can't do this for infinite years right? At some point you have to just create a final value at some point in the future. This is called our ""Terminal Value"" and it represents some generic assumptions about growth and costs of capital to give you an idea of what all the years beyond that are worth. The formula is pretty straight forward. If I want build a 5 year model, I will include my terminal value in year 5. The formula for figuring this out is as follows:

`Terminal CF = yr 5 FCFE * (1+g) / (WACC - g)`

Now there's a couple ways to think about this, but the easiest way is to simply view it as the value of all cash flows AFTER year 5 at an **assumed growth rate (g)** and assumed **cost of capital (WACC)**. This value is calculated as if you existed in year 5 already and assumed long run growth rate is also the same as the long run rate of growth in the economy. If you subscribe to Damodan's school of valuation (widely viewed as the authority on equity valuation modeling), there is an argument for g being the nominal gdp growth rate.

Now that we've put together the string of cash flows, what is the actual value of what you're receiving?

# Discount Rates:

This is the second component of the answer fewer people on here seem to incorporate when thinking about stocks. The idea here is that there is some inherent discount you need to apply to something you're going to receive in the future. It's a little bit longer but stick with me.

Let's take a step back and think about what that means. If I say I'm going to give you $100 tomorrow, generally you're pretty safe in assuming that's the same as having $100 today right? Cool that's fairly easy. Now what if I tell you I'll give you $50 in 10 years and $50 in 20 years. Are you going to value that the same as scenario 1? No right? Because if you get $100 tomorrow there's still 10+ years of time to do more productive things with that money than you would have in scenario 2 (i.e. invest it etc).

So how does this apply to valuations? Think of all those cash flows we talked about before. The value of ""buying the thing that gives you those cash flows"" is basically all of them summed up right? **Wrong**. Remember those cash flows are in the future... And things in the future are intrinsically worth less than they are today.

So how do we figure out what they worth today? Well that brings us to one of the most fundamental formulas in all of finance:

`FV = PV (1+r)^t`

That is, for a **given rate of growth (r)** and a **given amount of time (t)**, we can figure out what the future value of any amount will be.  If we know our future values, but not our present, then we can just flip this around and solve it the other way:

`PV = FV / (1+r)^t`

We already know FV is just the cash flows we talked about above already. So what is the 1/(1+r)\^t? That's what we call our discount factor and this is where we are finally getting to the topic of this post's title. t is super easy, years are years unless you're some sort of time traveler. The real question here is **""HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT RATE TO USE?""**. The answer in finance to discount your cash flows by the company's **Weighted Average Cost of Capital** or **WACC**. The concept here is that cost of capital comes in two broad components, cost of debt, and cost of equity. Cost of debt is sort of self explanatory. You have some debt, you owe interest on it each year, there's some marginal tax benefit by interest payments lowering your tax obligations, etc. But let's ignore this for a second and pretend we're looking at a company with zero debt.

What the fuck is ""**cost of equity**"" and what does it mean? It's far less tangible of a concept because there are no explicit interest payments that you can point to as ""costs"" like there are for debt. Instead some nobel prize winning financial economists (Jack Treynor \[mentor of Fischer Black\], William Sharpe \[known for the Sharpe Ratio\], and Merton Miller \[known for Modigliani-Miller Theory\]) captured essence of determining an equity share's ""cost"" through a theory called the **Capital Asset Pricing Model** or **CAPM** for short. This was a formula designed to determine what ""cost"" should be assigned to an asset based on a risk free rate of return, a market rate of return, and the inherent correlation of your asset with that market. You can see where I'm going with this. The formula is as follows:

`R(E) = Rrfr + B*(ERP)`

R(E) here represents the expected return of an asset. This can also be called your expected return on an equity or to the company issuing this equity it is the ""cost"" to them that's expected in return for the investor buying their equity.

Rrfr is just shorthand for the expected return on a risk free asset. You wouldn't ever buy into an equity share with the expectation that it gives you less than what the most risk free asset is right? Cool. So in the broad scheme of things there's a couple of things you could use for this, but one of the most common is the 10 year US Treasury yield (or some other duration US Treasury note/bill/bond). The US Government is widely believed to be the most risk free counterparty in the world. It's the nature of being a reserve currency.

B is your assets beta to the market. There's a lot we can unpack with this but for an oversimplification, let's think of it as for every 1% the broad market changes, how much does your equity change by?

And finally, ERP. This is the Equity Risk Premium. There's several ways to approach this but the simplest is to think of it as the general expectation of investors as to how much the broad market should outperform risk free assets. People purchase equity shares with the expectation of higher returns than safer assets? Seems reasonable.

Let's try this out with the broad market. Let's assume beta (B) is 1.0, the risk free rate is 1.0% and the ERP (expected spread between risk free and market) is 8%.

`R(E) = 1.5% + 1.0*(8%) = 9.5%`

That's a fairly reasonable rate. The sanity check here is comparing it to cost of debt. Because equities are lower in the capital structure, their cost should explicitly always be higher than the cost of debt. In the broad market companies are borrowing at less than 9.5% so that rough eyeball test checks out. If you invest in the broad equity market, your expectation is for companies to deliver 9.5% in value to you each year.

This finally brings us back to the topic of this post. You can see, wayyyy down in the granular details of a valuation, the equity markets fundamental valuation are inherently baselined on risk free rates. Now let's combine this with what we talked about above and see why such small changes in that tiny rate can have such large outcomes in valuations.

# Case Study: QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE: $QS)

I'll be honest, the reason I chose this is largely because it's one of the extreme examples that demonstrates how such small changes can make disproportionate impact. Also it seems to be a fan favorite whenever I see it mentioned.

For a case study I want to do a super rudimentary valuation. For disclosure, this is not a robust valuation or financial advice. I'm going to eliminate as many factors as possible and try to keep it just to what we talked about and help illustrate things. I'm not putting this here as DD or an opinion on this stock.

First things first, lets get some cash flows. For this we're not going to do anything fancy. When they were acquired by the \[insert s word thing that shall not be named\] they gave management forecasts and we're just going to take them at face value and extrapolate. Their projected first revenues will come in 2024 but it's nothing really material (14m FY24, 39m FY25, 260m FY26) until we get to FY27 (3.2bn). But remember, we don't care about revenues because as equity holders that's not what we receive. Looking at management's forecast, their Free Cash Flow doesn't turn positive until FY28 when it makes up \~8.5% of revenues. So lets use this and use some really wild assumptions. I'm going to say revenues go up by 75% each year after that and FCF margins stay the same at 10% (pretty insane growth assumptions given such a capital intensive manufacturing company).

&#x200B;

||2028|2029|2030|2031|2032|2033|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues ($m)|6500|11,375|19,906|34,836|60,963|106,685|
|Free Cash Flow ($m)|565|1,138|1,991|3,484|6,096|10,669|

Now we need to find our terminal value as if it is at the end of 2033 looking forward. Let's assume a relatively high steady state growth of 5% (3% real growth and 2% inflation). So our figure in year 5 is 106\*(1.05)/(.19-.05) = $133.3 billion

At first glance impressions are easy to be ""holy fuck, they're going to have $100 billion in revenue? they're generating cash flows of $150 billion?!? they're only at $15 billion market cap?? sign me the fuck up! buy buy buy!"". But let's take this all the way with step 2 of answering our ""What is this worth today?"" question.

So for this part we need to make a lot of assumptions. And this is important because equity analysts express their views often the most through not assumptions on how a company's cash flows look, but how to think about those cash flow value in present dollars.

Continuing our simplification, let's keep assuming no debt involvement here (mainly bc this post is fucking long) and let's jump back to using CAPM. Let's use the below values:

Rrfr: 1.0%

Beta: 2.0

ERP: 10%

Using these we can see this stock's cost of equity is \~21.0%. It seems high, but this is expected from something with such fantastic growth being priced in to have such a high beta. TSLA for example has a beta of 2.0 and realistically a stock growing at 75% yoy in an economy growing at 3% nominally would likely have a beta much higher than that.

So using our formula's above we can now now solve for our discount factors (the 1/(1+r)\^t numbers to multiply our cash flows by).

&#x200B;

|Year|FY2028|FY2029|FY2030|FY2031|FY2032|FY2033|

|Discount Factor|= 1 / (1.21)^(8)|= 1 / (1.21)^(9)|= 1 / (1.21)^(10)|= 1 / (1.21)^(11)|= 1 / (1.21)^(12)|= 1 / (1.21)^(13)|
|(DF)|0.22|0.18|0.15|0.12|0.10|0.08|
|PV CF ($m)|141|205|296|428|619|10,686|

The sum of all the PV CF should give us what we think this stock is worth today (since no debt, this would be same as market cap, ignoring any cash balances they currently have). So we get $12.4bn. Compared to a current $15 billion market cap that's another 20% drop WITH some pretty damn rosy assumptions (and low yields). Fuck.

But that's not all.

Now let's dial in new more realistic assumptions. Let's think of pre-covid life and what the norms back then were. 10 year interest rates were between 2-3% in 2018/2019 and inflation was tipping on the hot side of 2% going into end of year 2019, so a 10 year treasury at 2.5% seems a realistic norm and with a higher vol/growth stock like this we can be more realistically at a beta of 2.25. And finally let's keep our ERP and g (macro assumptions) the same.

Our cost of equity is now 25% which makes our discount table look like this:

|Year|FY2028|FY2029|FY2030|FY2031|FY2032|FY2033|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|t|8|9|10|11|12|13|
|WACC|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|
|Discount Factor|= 1 / (1.25)^(8)|= 1 / (1.25)^(9)|= 1 / (1.25)^(10)|= 1 / (1.25)^(11)|= 1 / (1.25)^(12)|= 1 / (1.25)^(13)|
|(DF)|0.17|0.13|0.11|0.09|0.07|0.05|
|PV CF ($m)|109|153|214|299|419|5,718|

With just a slight change in treasury yields and a slightly more realistic shift in beta, we're now talking about a market cap of $6.9bn or a 55% FURTHER DROP from current prices. Start shifting those 75%/yoy growth assumptions towards something that decelerates (a more complicated n-stage DCF that's too much to get into here) and you drop even further. A 10% deceleration yoy would bring this present value more in the $4 billion range.

I'm sorry for being so long winded here, but I felt it was important to explain. In a nutshell that folks, is the power of compounding and why small shifts in a seemingly benign rate can shift massive changes in values for these growth stocks that are primarily basing their value on cash flows happening 10-15 years from now.",stocks,submission,0.9997,0.053,0.811,0.135,50,reddit

Senate Democrats struck a last-minute agreement Friday to set federal unemployment benefits at $300 a week, down from the $400 passed by the House, but extend their duration by more than a month as part of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, according to a Democratic aide. Democrats hope to pass the bill before the mid-March cliff where enhanced federal unemployment benefits from the previous relief package expire.

The US added back the most jobs in four months in February, as falling coronavirus cases, an increase in the pace of vaccinations, and easing social distancing guidelines are allowing many businesses to reopen. Non-farm payrolls rose by 379,000 in February, or well above the 200,000 expected. The unemployment rate dipped to 6.2%, unexpectedly improving compared to January's 6.3%. The February jobs report also included a notable upward revision to payroll. January’s payroll gain was revised up to 166,000 from the tepid 49,000 previously reported.

In response to the positive jobs reports, Treasury yields rose once again to hover near its one-year high. The 10-year Treasury yield hit a high of 1.6% today before dipping to 1.557% at the time of writing. As a reminder, high expectations of economic growth causes Treasury yields to rise as the demand for bonds drops in order to make them more attractive. 

Rising interest rates hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now.

During a public appearance Thursday afternoon, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank will be “patient” in keeping interest rates near zero, even if inflationary pressures start to rise. Powell cautioned that as the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, the Fed could see signs of rising prices amid surging consumer spending. But the Fed chairman noted that he does not expect higher inflation to turn into anything resembling the double-digit inflation of the 1970s. He said, “If we do see what we believe is likely a transitory increase in inflation, where longer-term inflation expectations are broadly stable at levels consistent with our framework and goals, I expect that we will be patient.”

lys154_JNJ,JNJ,lys154,06/03/2021 02:00,10,"Hello everyone! I want to preface this with my brief stocks history. For the past decade of working/investing, I basically only held what I considered “safe” stocks based on advice from my conservative investing friends/family. I have owned JNJ, T, ABBV, etc. I also bought and held stocks like GE and MO near their “highs” but they have had big downturns and even 5+ years later have never recovered. 

Fast forward to 2021, I have accumulated some more savings and decide I would like to begin investing a portion of my individual portfolio a bit more aggressively. While I understand the gains from 2020 are unrealistic long term, my hope were for more aggressive investing with 10-20% yearly gains.

While I did not “put more than I can afford to lose”, I decided to invest in ARKG because I am personally fascinated by genomics and believe their impact on health can be transformative but I don’t know much about the individual companies. I also bought into a few other similar speculative stocks (such as Tesla because I personally like that they’re doing).  I understand speculative plays have more risk, but obviously did not expect the market/these securities to begin tanking literally days after I bought, placing me essentially at their ATH. Unlucky.

Many people have referenced a “zoomed out” view of the market showing what happens over time in the market and that even big crashes will eventually recover. However, what about the people that truly bought at the ATH? I hear everyone bringing up points that “ARK is still up 100% since last year even with the recent 30% drop”. But that doesn’t do much for people that bought at the top and are only seeing the 30% drop.

My question to the more seasoned investors is what makes you believe people in these situations ever truly recover? In my own history, I bought companies I thought there “well established boring long play” companies like GE and MO and when they went down, it never came back even 6-7 years later. Is the argument really that 7 years isn’t long enough? That it can take 10-15 years to recover from such a tank sometimes? Of course nobody has a crystal ball but I’d love to hear thoughts

I’m thankfully diversified enough (tech and speculative accounts for ~30% of my portfolio) but as we all know it hurts to see these huge drops and I’m just hoping to get some perspective. Thank you!",stocks,submission,0.9923,0.049,0.799,0.152,18,reddit

>In 2019, the couple sold Michael's family compound in Texas for US$28.5 million.[43][44]

>In 2020, Forbes listed Herd at number 39 of the top 100 ""America's richest self-made women"".

It was as high as $70 a few years back, then drilled for the core when Amazon took over Whole Foods as everyone assumed they'd also do the supply chain themselves and UNFI would lose a big chunk of their market. 

The news: Last week Amazon announced they'd be using UNFI til at least 2027.

Also, to get you monkeys going, they're shorted at over 20% of their float.

It saw modest gains last week, which is more impressive considering the sea of red in the markets. It could well be the start of a solid climb higher.",wallstreetbets,comment,0.8264,0.025,0.85,0.125,0,reddit

They stopped coming every day or became quiet, or hid their gang affiliation. Some watched as their fortunes slowly declined, Alpha Bull calls, and LEAPS's got destroyed. And eventually we made fun of them, scorning and spitting on them. By spring 2019, the famous ones would only check in from time to time.  


Memorial day weekend 2019 only the hardcore users stuck around the sub. All kinds of funny AF shenanigans would ensue. 4channers would show up, other subs would show up, we would raid other subs. Heady times. Well the weekend after, Sunday June 2, which seemed like the slowest weekend of the years as of yet, caught between spring and summer, there were just a few thousand users in the weekend discussion late night. some really positive Tesla news came out in the overnight (forget what). We started talking about it in the sub. And eventually realized the news was game changing, like if GME reinvented itself and pivoted. I forget now what the news was. But we made all of these funny ass posts wondering if the knights of Elon and the gang would rise again. Word spread all over the net. And so began the trickling in of real OG wsber's. Within a few hours, Long hodlers began showing up. By Monday, the sub took a turn. To me. That was the day the sub blew up. Those guys owned $TSLA at $36. They rehashed stories of almost giving up. That their LEAP's were long thought dead. And so began the exponential rise and growth of WSB. Everyone was now TESLA GANG.

gpucw0z_RKT,RKT,gpucw0z,06/03/2021 01:00,48,"I'm glad it's become less toxic in here.

* No more trolls calling people bagholders (really hard to do when this is the only green stock in WSB)
* Much less toxic cult behaviour (Although RKT attacks during the week have been shameful) 

On a more interesting note, I would love speculate current GME ownership:

* Ryan Cohen owns 9M shares (13%)\* 
* Mutual Funds > 52%\*\*
* Institutional Investors > 53% ? (need an update as data is based on Dec 31)
* Individuals 15.9%

I would not be surprised if we're getting closer to 20-30% ownership by individuals. A lot of folks who made gains from the first run are coming back in and I did some back-of-napkin calculations based on a poll that was run during the first run:

\> 40% of people in the poll said they owned 1-5 shares  
\> 23% said they owned 5-20 shares  
\> 18% said they owned 20-50 shares

Apparently half of RH 13M users had a GME stake. 

I would say that probably 2 out of the 9M apes here own a GME stake. (Possibly even higher)  
If we assume 2M people \* an average of 8.2 shares per person = 16.4M shares (We would own 23% of the company)

Higher interest rates (even though they aren't even a thing yet) are going to hit high P/E companies especially hard because it means that they can borrow less and thus their growth is stifled. The higher 10 year bond is one of the indicators that the economy is returning to 'normal' and this may trigger a shift in the Feds fiscal policy which may mean an increase in interest rates earlier than originally anticipated. 

It is a bit of a double whammy this time because it also means that people are reassessing their allocation based on new risk/reward possibilities, higher bond yields which are essentially risk free mean that people who were previously over invested in stock can now reallocate a portion of their portfolio to bonds for a guaranteed return, if the yield crosses over the average dividend line (which it has already) then things get even worse in the short term for stocks. 

In the long run this is probably a short term dip, so people who aren't playing short expiry options will probably be fine if they hold in the long term. However if there is one thing I've learned is the market can remain irrational longer than the average person can remain liquid, so do your DD and for the love of god don't sell at a loss if you are holding stocks in a company you believe in long-term.",investing,comment,0.7197,0.074,0.838,0.088,0,reddit

# Revenue Generation

Roblox generates revenue in several ways. Players purchase Robux directly for prices ranging from $4.99 to $99.99. Players can spend Robux on game-specific purchases that goes to the Creators with a 30% fee taken out.

Creators can exchange Robux for USD at a current rate $350 per 100,000 Robux as of March 4, 2020. To purchase 100,000 Robux would require 10 purchases of the $99.99 package (10k Robux each) for a total of $999.90.

Roblox also offers three subscription tiers ranging from $4.99 to $19.99 a month, which earns a player Robux and Exclusive store items.

Merchandise plays a role in revenue generation as well. Roblox offers clothing, figurines and gift cards which can be purchased online and in person from places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, and other retail locations.

# Growth Potential and Catalyst

The current outlook for Roblox to grow is promising. There are active investments being made in expanding the age range, international reach, monetization, and technical capabilities of the platform. By continuing to employ modern technology to improve the platform, higher quality experiences and content that appeals to older age demographics can be created.

Current international markets for Roblox include US, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Roblox is actively investing in technology that they hope will enhance their growth around the world. For example, they hope to use automated translation and built-in regional compliance tools to help scale into other global markets.

Monetization is another key component to Roblox growing. Recently Roblox Premium which offers a monthly subscription service to its users was added. Roblox actively works with its creator and developer community to help bring them improve their monetization, which in turn increases Roblox’s monetization. Roblox expects to work with leading brands to build unique marketing opportunities to the platform.

# Competitors and Differences

One of the things to keep in mind about Roblox itself is not a game, but a gaming platform and ecosystem of multiple gaming experiences. Over 18 million games can be launched from their website and played through a downloaded app on the user’s computer. Each game can be completely unique from every other game.

Roblox as a platform would more closely related to that of Steam (by Valve) or Epic Games Launcher (by Epic) or Origin (by EA). However, instead of purchasing games through this, a user simply launches whichever one of these free experiences they want at any time. There is no purchasing of the game like there is on the other mentioned platforms.

Roblox’s main difference is they use the underlying tools to create Roblox specific games utilizing their Software Development Kit (SDK). Other games launched on Steam or Epic are much more loosely connected to the platforms distributing it, whereas Roblox games are highly connected to the Roblox platform in general. The barrier of entry to create a Roblox gaming experience is much less difficult than to create a game to release on other distribution platforms, however the games themselves are “Roblox-centric” and have common styling, controls, and gaming mechanisms.

Roblox does not charge for the games themselves, but a user buys virtual items and enhancements through their virtual currency called Robux (See “Revenue Generation”). A user can also be a Roblox Creator who can create virtual items that will appear on their character in all games. They can also create their own Roblox experiences and sell items unique to that game on their own store for Robux. Robux can then be turned into real money (100k Robux -> $350 USD) if the creator wishes to cash out, or they can spend it for themselves within Roblox.

# The User Experience and YouTube Scene

When a Roblox player wants to play a game, they navigate to the Roblox website and login. This allows them to browse a list of games and launch the experience within a downloaded application on their computer called the Roblox Player.

Users on the website can change their avatar and browse the shop for various items such as gear, emotes, characters, and other customizations. Players can connect with their friends or join 1 or more groups of other players to form smaller communities to play together.

Roblox is massive in the YouTube scene. The official Roblox channel has \~2.9 Million Subscribers. Some YouTube creators attempt to create their own content and promote it on their channel to earn Robux, which they can then exchange for real-life cash.

Roblox can appeal to different age groups for different reasons. While younger age-groups are the ones playing the game, older age-groups are finding ways to make tons of money as developers and creators.

*In 2020, Roblox was the second most watched game on YouTube (second only to Minecraft)*

# Conclusion

Being relatively new to trading and this being my first due-diligence for a company, I hesitate to make any sort of predictions personally on where this price will go up or down. My gut tells me the $45 price doesn't feel over or under valued, but I think Roblox has a lot of growth potential over the next year.

lymi5h_CCJ,CCJ,lymi5h,05/03/2021 21:00,66,"As we close the book on another chaotic week, I wanted to share my views on the current state of clean energy investing, on uranium in particular, and where I see this heading. As always, any and all feedback is greatly appreciated. 

**First, one thing to get out of the way.** 

Last night, a relatively small Canadian uranium miner, Denison Mines Corp, (**$DNN**), trades at less than $1, and was a top 5 trending stock ahead of its earnings. The message boards were typical gains propaganda and it became another sad pump and dump story.

As a long-time uranium investor, watching tens of millions of $DNN shares change hands in after-hours was a real sign of the times, which, I guess is a nice way of saying that a lot of people are living a ridiculous fantasy when it comes to investing.   

This is a pretty good segue into clean energy since a lot of folks are living a fantasy there as well. We cannot power the Earth on wind and solar alone. And we do not have the battery capacity to store it. **It is simple math**. Either we maintain the status quo on coal, oil and natural gas, or we embrace uranium as part of the solution. 

**Here is how I see the market on uranium developing going forward.**

Generally speaking, I am looking at this as a **macro investment based on the supply and demand dynamics of the market**.  At a high level, uranium needs to be in the $50+ (some say $60+) range in order to cover the cost of production.  Right now the spot price is hovering around $30.    

**On the demand side** \- From what I have researched, utilities have managed to get by with fuel reserves and long term contracts, however the long term contracts are expiring and fuel reserves are working their way through the market. **This presents a scenario where buyers will need to start coming into the market to lock in new long term contracts**. 

There is also the question of **China’s growing influence in nuclear.** This will increase global demand significantly over the next few decades.  China has been and, I am guessing, will **continue to secure supply with a long term geopolitical strategic view**.

**On the supply side** \- There is a ton of uranium in the world but it is challenging to mine it at the current costs.  New mines take years to come on line (finding, permitting, developing, exporting, etc).  This results in a **relatively small number of companies that actually produce uranium or have the potential to produce uranium in the next cycle**.  There seem to be a lot of companies talking a big game but I have tried to stay with companies that either are or can produce uranium in the next few years.  If anyone is interested, I am happy to provide a list of companies that I have been successful with. 

There are also secondary sources of supply which are harder to find numbers on.  One secondary source is from decommissioned nuclear weapons (the US had/has an agreement to buy uranium from the Russians).  There are several good reports on the supply side from the nuclear associations.

**The major catalyst in Q4 that resulted in the upswing in equities was a supply side story.**  Two or three major mines (CCJ and the Kazaks) were shut down due to COVID scares and/or because of the economics.  The market took some notice and equities jumped significantly.  This said, the price of uranium has not moved publicly.  I expect equities to decrease from today's levels until the price moves up.  

**Once the price moves I think we will see 3x - 5x from today's levels.  This could take a few years, but my bet is that we start to see moves sooner**.  

As said at the outset, I would be very appreciative of any feedback. I could be wrong on this and it would be great to get a critical eye.

lyya8p_ODFL,ODFL,lyya8p,06/03/2021 09:00,3,"Citing “a strong economic recovery with robust freight demand,” less-than-truckload carrier Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ: ODFL) announced Thursday plans to add 800 drivers and more than 400 dockworkers and clerical personnel.

The Thomasville, North Carolina-based company said it was looking to add Class A CDL drivers over the next three months to meet growing demand. The plans include hiring 275 linehaul drivers, 260 pickup and delivery drivers and 100 team drivers. It will also add more than 430 workers on its docks over the same time period.

Average pay for new linehaul drivers will be $99,000, with pickup and delivery drivers earning $73,000 annually. The full-time, nonunion positions also offer health insurance, 401(k) and paid vacation. Old Dominion will pay a $5,000 signing bonus for qualified drivers in certain locations.
“Our OD people are the heart of our operations and we’re looking to add to our workforce in response to a growing demand for our premium service,” said Marty Freeman, EVP and COO at Old Dominion. “There’s never been a better time to consider a career in transportation. These career opportunities offer a great work-life balance, a competitive compensation package, on-the-job training and career advancement opportunity.”


Old Dominion’s announcement comes as the carrier is executing a terminal expansion plan, which produced nine new or expanded facilities in 2020. Similar additions are planned for 2021. The facility expansion is part of the company’s efforts to increase market share in a favorable trucking environment.

On Tuesday, the carrier announced that year-over-year trends in February (revenue +9.2%) slowed from more robust growth seen in January (revenue +14.6%). Severe winter storms were noted as the reason for the deceleration in the growth rate. Even with the slowdown, the carrier fared better than others in the month.
Saia (NASDAQ: SAIA) reported a 2.3% year-over-year decline in February tonnage after posting a 5.4% increase in January. The company said roughly 70 terminals were fully or partially offline for several days during the month.
ArcBest Corp. (NASDAQ: ARCB) reported flat tonnage through the first two months of the year in its asset-based segment as February wiped out a 6.6% year-over-year increase to start the year.

Okay so let me spit ball here. The market moved how it wants and does what it wants in my opinion. Most of the time i feel we are chasing the market trying to catch up with it to make gains. 

Over time ive learned for the biggest gains you have to think outside the box and basically go against what everyone is saying. 99% of the time everyone's like Cramer said by XYZ so i sold XYZ and bought ABC and made a huge return... so now people are claiming bail out of big tech. Tech is over. Run and buy value stocks like JPM. But why? Cramer and everyone else is telling you sell your tech and that you need to buy value and reopening trades (most of which are already recovered). So why now listen? Why sell all your value stocks with unlimited potential for a value stock that probably isnt gonna return much. 

If we follow the buy the rumor sell the news... shouldn't we be selling value and buying tech? 

Most of us probably hold a large tech portion and guess what its for good reason... why not just average down while you can? This is my evidence of how big tech is gonna sling shot back quickly and hard once all this BS is over (granted might be a few months who knows). 

Take Square... January 27th $203 --> February 19th $268 --> February 25th $227 (first big dip) --> March 2nd $252 (first false recovery) --> March 4th $217 (today).

So look at that movement. Hit close to all time high fell and then did a massive recovery in less than a week. Now dropped again. By this premise why not keep these positions and average down? If you take January 27th to today you are actually up $14... 

Look at things like qqq and voo they are hitting at or below there 100 day EMA (AKA Huge sale)

For me im keeping my positions and averaging down. I dont have a crystal ball but i definitely will be averaging down and i for see at least a week or two maybe even a month before then fully recover and start trending up. So where do you wanna be? Sold and trying to time the bottom? Or holding averaging down and making money on way up?

So look at that movement. Hit close to all time high fell and then did a massive recovery in less than a week. Now dropped again. By this premise why not keep these positions and average down? If you take January 27th to today you are actually up $14... 

Look at things like qqq and voo they are hitting at or below there 100 day EMA (AKA Huge sale)

For me im keeping my positions and averaging down. I dont have a crystal ball but i definitely will be averaging down and i for see at least a week or two maybe even a month before then fully recover and start trending up. So where do you wanna be? Sold and trying to time the bottom? Or holding averaging down and making money on way up?

Okay so let me spit ball here. The market moved how it wants and does what it wants in my opinion. Most of the time i feel we are chasing the market trying to catch up with it to make gains. 

Over time ive learned for the biggest gains you have to think outside the box and basically go against what everyone is saying. 99% of the time everyone's like Cramer said by XYZ so i sold XYZ and bought ABC and made a huge return... so now people are claiming bail out of big tech. Tech is over. Run and buy value stocks like JPM. But why? Cramer and everyone else is telling you sell your tech and that you need to buy value and reopening trades (most of which are already recovered). So why now listen? Why sell all your value stocks with unlimited potential for a value stock that probably isnt gonna return much. 

If we follow the buy the rumor sell the news... shouldn't we be selling value and buying tech?
